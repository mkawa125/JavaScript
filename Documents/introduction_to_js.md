# JavaScript Programming

## Introduction to JavaScript

### What is JavaScript, What can we do with it, Which other technology play well with it

> JavaScript is the programming language developed for html and web. Initially was developed to make web pages alive. They can run automatically as the web page loads. Initially JavaScript was given the name of liveScript. It has evolved and  becoming independent language with its own specification called ECMASCRIPT.

### What can JavaScript do in browsers.

- Add new html on the page, change existing content and modify styles
- React on user actions
- send request on network
- get and set cookies
- Remember on the client side

### What does JavaScript can not do on browsers
* JavaScript does not have direct access to OS system functions
* Ability to receive data from server is crippled

### Code editors used in JavaScript development (Recommended)
1. Visual Studio Code
2. WebStorm

### Developer console
``` 
1. By default in JavaScript user  can not see error on browsers so if something went wrong on script we can not see it and fix it. To see errors and making useful on it developer tools have embedded on browsers.
```
```
2. Click F12  to open developer tools. The developer tools will open console tab by default.
```

### Code Structure Block of code

> Here we shall learn about building the block of codes. In Java script statement is termed as the block of code, statements can be separated by comma but it can can be ommited if line break exist.

```
a.  Statement separated by comma
    alert('Hello'); alert('World');

b.  Statement with comma ommited
    alert('Hello');
    alert('World');

```

### Use strict mode
The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

For example:
```
"use strict";

// this code works the modern way
...
```
