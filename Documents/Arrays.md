### JSON.stringify
> The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a general format to represent values and objects. It is described as in RFC 4627 standard. Initially it was made for JavaScript, but many other languages have libraries to handle it as well. So itâ€™s easy to use JSON for data exchange when the client uses JavaScript and the server is written on Ruby/PHP/Java/Whatever.

JavaScript provides methods:

- JSON.stringify to convert objects into JSON.
- JSON.parse to convert JSON back into an object.
